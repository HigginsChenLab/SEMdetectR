\title{Detect Stochastic Epigenetic Mutations (SEMs) Using IQR Method}
\usage{
CountSEM(data, reference = data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame or matrix with methylation data, samples as rows and CpG sites as columns.}

\item{reference}{Optional reference data frame or matrix to calculate quantiles for SEM detection.
If not provided, \code{data} itself is used as reference.}
}
\value{
A list with two elements: 'hyperSEM' and 'hypoSEM', vectors containing counts of hyper and hypo SEMs per sample.
}
\description{
This function detects hyper and hypo stochastic epigenetic mutations (SEMs) in DNA methylation data
by applying an interquartile range (IQR) based method.
}

Intended for internal package use.
